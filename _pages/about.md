I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Jilin University, working with [Assoc. Prof. Xin Wang](https://xinwangjlu.github.io/). I received my master's degree in School of Artificial Intelligence from Jilin University in 2023, and my bachelor's degree in College of Computer Science and Technology from Jilin University in 2020. My industry experience includes working as an Algorithm Engineer at ByteDance (Douyin E-Commerce) from 2023 to 2024, and serving as an Algorithm Intern at ByteDance during my graduate studies. Since August 2025, I have been working as a research intern at Alibaba Cloud Computing.

My research interests center on developing efficient, trustworthy, and application-driven machine learning algorithms, with a particular focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), contrastive learning, and the integration of graph learning with large language models (Graph+LLM) and retrieval-augmented generation (Graph+RAG). I work extensively in areas such as graph learning, information retrieval, and AI for science, aiming to advance both foundational methodologies and impactful real-world applications.
